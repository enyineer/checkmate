# Authentication & SSO

Checkstack provides flexible authentication options for both small teams and enterprise environments.

## Built-in Authentication

### Credential Login
Standard email/password authentication with:
- Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- Password reset via email
- Account lockout protection

### GitHub OAuth
Single sign-on using GitHub accounts. Users authenticate through GitHub and are automatically created in Checkstack on first login.

## Enterprise SSO

### SAML 2.0

Checkstack supports SAML 2.0 Service Provider (SP) initiated SSO, enabling integration with enterprise identity providers:

- **Okta**
- **Azure Active Directory**
- **OneLogin**
- **Google Workspace**
- **Any SAML 2.0 compliant IdP**

#### Configuration

Navigate to **Settings → Authentication → Strategies** and configure the SAML strategy:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `IdP Metadata URL` | URL to your IdP's SAML metadata (recommended) |
| `IdP SSO URL` | Single Sign-On URL (if not using metadata) |
| `IdP Certificate` | X.509 certificate for signature validation |
| `SP Entity ID` | Unique identifier for Checkstack (default: `checkstack`) |
| `Attribute Mapping` | Map SAML claims to user fields (email, name) |

### LDAP/Active Directory

Checkstack supports LDAP and Active Directory authentication:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `Server URL` | LDAP server URL (e.g., `ldaps://ldap.example.com:636`) |
| `Bind DN` | Service account for searching users |
| `Bind Password` | Service account password |
| `Base DN` | Search base (e.g., `ou=users,dc=example,dc=com`) |
| `Search Filter` | User search filter (e.g., `(uid={0})` or `(sAMAccountName={0})`) |

## Group-to-Role Mapping

Both SAML and LDAP strategies support automatic role assignment based on directory group memberships.

### How It Works

1. **Group Extraction**: When a user authenticates, Checkstack extracts their group memberships from the directory response
2. **Mapping Lookup**: Groups are matched against configured mappings
3. **Role Assignment**: Matched Checkstack roles are assigned to the user

### Configuration

Enable group mapping in the strategy configuration:

```
Group Mapping:
  ├── Enabled: true
  ├── Group Attribute: memberOf (LDAP) or http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/claims/Group (SAML)
  ├── Mappings:
  │   ├── Directory Group: CN=Developers,OU=Groups,DC=example,DC=com
  │   │   Checkstack Role: developers
  │   ├── Directory Group: CN=Admins,OU=Groups,DC=example,DC=com
  │   │   Checkstack Role: admin
  └── Default Role: users (optional, assigned to all users from this directory)
```

### Managed Role Sync

Checkstack uses a **managed role sync** pattern that distinguishes between directory-controlled roles and manually-assigned roles:

**Managed Roles** (roles configured in mappings):
- ✅ Added when user gains group membership in directory
- ✅ Removed when user loses group membership in directory
- ✅ Fully synchronized on every login

**Unmanaged Roles** (roles not in any mapping):
- ✅ Preserved during sync
- ✅ Can be manually assigned/removed by Checkstack administrators
- ✅ Not affected by directory changes

**Example Scenario:**
1. User belongs to "Developers" group in AD → assigned `developers` role
2. User is also manually assigned `reporting-viewer` role in Checkstack
3. User is removed from "Developers" group in AD
4. On next login: `developers` role is removed, `reporting-viewer` role is preserved

### Invalid Role Handling

If a mapping contains a role ID that no longer exists in Checkstack:
- The invalid role is silently skipped
- Other valid roles are still assigned
- Authentication succeeds (never fails due to mapping issues)

## API Tokens (External Applications)

For machine-to-machine access, create **External Applications** in **Settings → Authentication → Applications**:

- Each application receives an API key (`ck_<appId>_<secret>`)
- Assign roles to control what the application can access
- Optionally assign to teams for resource-level access

See [External Applications](./external-applications.md) for more details.
