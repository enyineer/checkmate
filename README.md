## ✨ What is Checkstack?

**Checkstack** is a self-hosted, open-source status page and monitoring platform that helps you:

- 📊 **Monitor** your services with automated health checks
- 📢 **Communicate** incidents and maintenance to your users
- 🔔 **Notify** stakeholders through multiple channels instantly
- 🔌 **Integrate** with your existing tools and workflows

Think of it as your all-in-one solution for operational visibility - combining the power of a status page, uptime monitoring, and incident management into a single, extensible platform.

## 🚀 Key Features

### System Catalog
> *Your single source of truth for all monitored services*

Organize your infrastructure into **Systems** and **Groups**. Track dependencies, assign owners, and maintain a clear inventory of everything that matters.

---

### Health Checks
> *Know when things break - before your users do*

**Built-in Check Types:**

| Category | Provider | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Network** | HTTP/HTTPS | Endpoint monitoring with status codes, headers, body assertions |
| | Ping (ICMP) | Network reachability with packet loss and latency tracking |

- **Automatic Transitions** - Status changes from "Planned" → "Active" → "Completed"
- **Multi-System Impact** - Associate maintenance with multiple affected services
- **User Notifications** - Alert subscribers before and during maintenance

---

### Multi-Channel Notifications
> *Reach people where they are*

| Channel | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 📧 **SMTP** | Email notifications with templated content |
| 💬 **Telegram** | Instant messaging with rich formatting |

| 💼 **Microsoft Teams** | Post to channels and manage conversations |
| 🌐 **Webex** | Post to Webex spaces with Adaptive Cards |
| 🔗 **Webhooks** | Custom HTTP callbacks for any event |

Event-driven architecture means you can react to health changes, incidents, and maintenance with automated workflows.

---

### API & Automation
> *Integrate programmatically with your infrastructure*

Checkstack exposes a comprehensive REST API that enables external systems to interact with the platform programmatically via **API keys** (service accounts):

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🚨 **Monitoring Alerts** | Prometheus, Grafana, or PagerDuty can create/resolve incidents automatically |
| 🚀 **CI/CD Pipelines** | Schedule maintenance windows during deployments |
| 🏗️ **Infrastructure as Code** | Terraform, Pulumi, or Ansible can manage systems and groups |
| ⚙️ **Deployment Scripts** | Configure health checks as part of service provisioning |
| 🔗 **Custom Integrations** | Any external tool can interact via authenticated API calls |

**Example: Create an incident from an external alerting system**
```bash
curl -X POST https://checkstack.local/api/incident/createIncident \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ck_<appId>_<secret>" \
  -d '{"title": "High CPU Alert", "status": "investigating", "systemIds": ["..."]}'
```

API keys are managed via **Settings → External Applications** with full RBAC permission control.

---

### Flexible Authentication & Access Control
> *Secure access with enterprise-grade granularity*

**Authentication Methods:**
- **Credential Login** - Built-in username/password with secure password reset
- **GitHub OAuth** - Single sign-on with GitHub
- **SAML 2.0** - Enterprise SSO with identity providers (Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin, etc.)
- **LDAP/AD** - Enterprise directory integration with Active Directory
- **API Tokens** - Service accounts for machine-to-machine access

**Directory Group-to-Role Mapping:**
- Automatically assign Checkstack roles based on directory group memberships
- Configure mappings in SAML/LDAP strategy settings with dynamic role dropdowns
- Additive sync: directory roles are added without removing manually-assigned roles
- Optional default role for all users from a specific directory

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
- Define custom roles with specific permissions
- Assign roles to users for platform-wide access rules
- Preconfigured roles for common use cases (Admin, Viewer, etc.)

**Resource-Level Access Control (RLAC):**
- Grant teams fine-grained access to individual resources
- Configure read-only or full management permissions per resource
- Enable "Team Only" mode to restrict resources exclusively to team members

**Team Management:**
- Organize users into logical teams (e.g., "Platform Team", "API Developers")
- Designate **Team Managers** who can manage membership and settings
- Assign **External Applications** (API keys) to teams for automated workflows

### Plugin Architecture
> *Extend everything*

Checkstack is built from the ground up as a **modular plugin system**:

- 🧩 **Backend Plugins** - Add new APIs, services, database schemas
- 🎨 **Frontend Plugins** - Extend UI with new pages, components, themes
- 🔗 **Integration Providers** - Connect to new external services
- 📡 **Notification Strategies** - Deliver alerts through new channels
- ✅ **Health Check Strategies** - Monitor services in custom ways

## 🖥️ Technology Stack

| Layer | Technologies |
|-------|--------------|
| **Runtime** | [Bun](https://bun.sh) |
| **Backend** | [Hono](https://hono.dev), [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team), [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) |
| **Frontend** | [React](https://react.dev), [Vite](https://vitejs.dev), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com), [ShadCN/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com) |
| **Validation** | [Zod](https://zod.dev) |
| **Realtime** | WebSocket (native Bun) |
| **Queue** | BullMQ (Redis) / In-Memory |

## 📦 Deployment

### Docker

The easiest way to run Checkstack — works for both **production deployment** and **local testing**.

**👉 [Full Docker Getting Started Guide](./docs/getting-started/docker.md)**

#### Quick Start with Docker Compose

The repository includes a ready-to-use `docker-compose.yml`:

```bash
# Create .env with required secrets (see docs for details)
# Then start everything
docker compose up -d
```

To update to the latest version:

```bash
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

#### Single Container

Checkstack requires four environment variables:

| Variable | Description | How to Generate |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string | Your database provider |
| `ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY` | 64 hex chars (32 bytes) | `openssl rand -hex 32` |
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Min 32 characters | `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `BASE_URL` | Public URL for Checkstack | Your domain (e.g., `https://status.example.com`) |

```bash
# Pull and run the latest version
docker pull ghcr.io/enyineer/checkstack:latest
docker run -d \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/checkstack \
  -e ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
  -e BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32) \
  -e BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  ghcr.io/enyineer/checkstack:latest
```

> [!TIP]
> After first start, you'll have to create your first admin user.
>
> Upon opening the page eg. at `http://localhost:3000` you'll be greeted with a signup form.


### NPM Packages

All `@checkstack/*` packages are published to npm for plugin developers.

> ⚠️ **Bun Required**: These packages publish TypeScript source directly and require [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime. They are **not compatible with Node.js**.

```bash
# Example: Install packages for a custom plugin
bun add @checkstack/backend-api @checkstack/common
```

## 🏃 Development Setup

> For **contributors** and **plugin developers**. For just running Checkstack, use [Docker](#docker) instead.

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) installed
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) running

### Run the Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/enyineer/checkstack.git
cd checkstack

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Start everything (Docker + Backend + Frontend)
bun run dev
```

This command will automatically:
1. 🐳 Start the Docker infrastructure (Postgres & PgAdmin)
2. 🔧 Start the Backend server (Port 3000)
3. 🎨 Start the Frontend server (Vite default port)

> [!TIP]
> After first start, you'll have to create your first admin user.
>
> Upon opening the page eg. at `http://localhost:3000` you'll be greeted with a signup form.

### Infrastructure Details

| Service | URL | Credentials |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| **Frontend** | `http://localhost:5173` | - |
| **Backend API** | `http://localhost:3000` | - |
| **PgAdmin** | `http://localhost:5050` | `admin@checkstack.com` / `admin` |
| **PostgreSQL** | `localhost:5432` | `checkstack` / `checkstack` |

```bash
# Stop Docker containers
bun run docker:stop
```
